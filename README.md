# BlazorForms Sample

This is a sample project whose purpose is to show off both Blazor EditForms in a real working example as well as provide a use case to develop the [SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions](https://github.com/SpiralAngle/SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions) library.

## Working with that submodule

**Note**: This uses a submodule for the SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions folder. See <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules> for more information.

When you clone this use:

``` shell
git clone --recurse-submodules [url to BlazorFormsSample git repo].
```

To get updates from the master branch for all submodules:

``` shell
git submodule update --remote
```
